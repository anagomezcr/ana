OOP:
  - Instance of operator
  - Exceptions a core class type

CLASSES:
  - Chained constructor calling. Right now it is single inher
  - Chained property access, via all base classes
  - Remove self requirement for class instance variables
  - Properly install the self object into methods, right now
    if a name is assigned to a instance method, the `self` variable
    will not be available

Import Statements:
  - Should be straightforward
