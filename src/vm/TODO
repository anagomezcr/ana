TODO: August 18, 2018

- Need to make more test cases for the import statements
- Implement binary bitwise operations
- Determine if all types operate on standard operators in an expected way
- Implement the REPL
- All instances of the `throw` operation should not convert the operand to a 
  string, need full support for an Exception type in the main loop
- compiler errors, that are useful
- Real C api that is easy to use, with full support for extensions to the main 
  types

OOP:
  - Instance of operator
  - Exceptions a core class type
