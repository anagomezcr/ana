OOP:
  - Instance of operator
  - Exceptions a core class type
  - Base constructor calling rules, for when there are arguments, etc
    - Perhaps, a base constructor is only called if it's the 
      constructor with no arguments?
  - Chained constructor calling. Right now it is single.
  - Chained inhertience, right now it's only immediate parent
  - Prevent constructor from being called twice
      - This can happen, for example, when a child class method
      - trys to call the base() name, but that should only work in the
        the class construtor and only once.


Operators need to be tested, one test suite for each operator, on each type


Import Statements:
  - Should be straightforward
